# recycler-test-app
Basic Android app focused on front-end. It has a recycler view with cards, buttons and images and a snackbar with an action. It supports android dark mode and saves the current instance for short app terminations.

Its purpose is to be a possible ACtivity for choosing different items (in this case a short list of pokes).
